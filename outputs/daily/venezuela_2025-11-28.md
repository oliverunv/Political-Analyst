U.S. President Donald Trump recently communicated with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, discussing a potential meeting in the United States. This development comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries, particularly concerning U.S. actions against Venezuelan drug trafficking. Trump announced plans for land operations to combat drug trafficking from Venezuela, further escalating the situation. The U.S. has also designated Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as a "foreign terrorist organization." In response to these developments, Maduro has instructed the Venezuelan military to prepare for defense. Additionally, the northeastern Venezuelan state of Sucre is experiencing increased security patrols following U.S. bombings targeting drug boats in the region. This has led to heightened surveillance by local authorities and increased fear among residents. Meanwhile, Venezuela has suspended flights between Buenos Aires and Caracas due to tensions in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. In a separate move, the Venezuelan government plans to increase flights to Russia after revoking the concessions of six airlines that ceased operations in the country.
