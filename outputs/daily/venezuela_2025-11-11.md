Venezuela is currently experiencing a resurgence of inflation, a persistent economic issue that has plagued the country for years. This development comes amidst increasing tensions with the United States, which has intensified its military presence in the region. The U.S. has launched maritime strikes against suspected drug traffickers and deployed a large naval fleet near Venezuela, actions that have been defended by U.S. officials as necessary for national security. However, these moves have sparked criticism and raised questions about their legality and the evidence linking Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to drug cartels. In response to the perceived threat of a U.S. attack, the Venezuelan military is reportedly preparing a guerrilla-style resistance, utilizing both modern and older Russian-made weapons. Meanwhile, the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar in Venezuela, as provided by the Banco Central de Venezuela, remains a crucial factor for economic transactions in the country.
