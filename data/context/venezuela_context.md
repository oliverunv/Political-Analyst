# Contextual Analysis: Venezuela, October 2025

Venezuela remains under Nicolás Maduro’s control following the disputed 2024 election.
Security institutions remain loyal through patronage networks tied to oil revenues and illicit trade.
The opposition—symbolized by Nobel laureate María Corina Machado—retains strong international legitimacy but limited domestic leverage.
The United States has adopted a stance of coercive ambiguity, combining Caribbean military deployments and limited strikes with pragmatic engagement on energy and migration.
Key regional governments (Colombia, Mexico, Brazil) oppose intervention, while Russia, China, and Iran continue to sustain the regime diplomatically and economically.
The economy is semi-dollarized, public services fragile, and some 7.8 million Venezuelans have emigrated.
Regime stability remains high in the short term, but U.S. pressure, economic decay, and elite fatigue could eventually open a negotiated path—or provoke more assertive U.S. moves toward regime change.
