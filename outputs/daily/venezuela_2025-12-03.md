**Daily Update on Venezuela - December 3, 2025**

The U.S. political landscape is currently focused on potential military actions against Venezuela. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Senators Schumer, Kaine, Paul, and Schiff, have introduced a War Powers Resolution aimed at preventing President Trump from initiating unauthorized military action in Venezuela. This legislative move comes in response to Trump's recent social media statements suggesting a closure of Venezuelan airspace and hints at possible ground operations. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is facing criticism over a recent U.S. strike on a Venezuelan drug boat, with allegations of it being a war crime. In Venezuela, the government-controlled National Assembly has proposed revoking the nationality of five opposition figures, accusing them of misappropriating Citgo, a subsidiary of the state oil company PDVSA in the U.S. Additionally, satellite images have revealed increased U.S. naval activity in the Caribbean, with ships positioned near Venezuela, further escalating tensions.
