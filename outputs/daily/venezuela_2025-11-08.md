Spanish police have arrested 13 suspected members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua. The arrests took place across five cities: Barcelona, Madrid, Girona, A Coruña, and Valencia. This operation marks Spain's first major effort to dismantle a cell of the Venezuelan prison gang, which is involved in drug trafficking. During the raids, authorities seized a significant amount of illegal drugs and dismantled two drug laboratories. The Tren de Aragua gang is recognized by the U.S. government as a foreign terrorist organization.

In a separate development, U.S. B-52 bombers conducted their fourth flight near Venezuela's coast recently as part of an anti-drug trafficking campaign. This has led to increased regional tensions, with Venezuela putting its F-16 fighter jets on alert. The Venezuelan government perceives these military maneuvers as provocative actions aimed at destabilizing President Nicolás Maduro's administration.
