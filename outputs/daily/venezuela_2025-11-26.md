The United States has intensified its stance against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with President Donald Trump authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. Additionally, U.S. military forces, including troops, fighter jets, and warships, have been positioned near the Venezuelan coastline. This move follows the U.S. designation of Maduro as a leader of a terrorist organization, specifically the Cartel of the Suns, which has opened the possibility of his military capture. In response, Maduro has publicly vowed to defy the U.S., appearing in military attire and brandishing a sword at a rally in Caracas, symbolizing a call to defend Venezuela against perceived external threats.

Separately, India and Venezuela have agreed to strengthen their bilateral relations, focusing on cooperation in trade, health, pharmaceuticals, digital technology, and agriculture. This agreement was reached during the 5th Foreign Office Consultations held in New Delhi, reflecting ongoing diplomatic engagements between the two nations.
