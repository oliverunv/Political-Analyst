On October 29, 2025, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced that he has requested the Supreme Court to consider a constitutional amendment that would allow the government to revoke the nationality of individuals who support foreign military interventions in Venezuela. This move is seen as a response to perceived threats of foreign invasion and internal dissent. Meanwhile, reports have emerged about a failed U.S. operation to capture Maduro by allegedly attempting to bribe his personal pilot to divert his plane to a location where U.S. authorities could arrest him. Additionally, the U.S. military continues to target boats suspected of drug trafficking from Venezuela, while Venezuelan oil tankers reportedly continue to operate in the Caribbean despite U.S. sanctions. In domestic matters, Venezuelan fishermen have expressed concerns over government crackdowns, which they claim pose a greater threat to their livelihoods than U.S. military actions. Furthermore, opposition leader María Corina Machado criticized Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's proposal to mediate between the U.S. and the Venezuelan government, questioning its potential effectiveness.
