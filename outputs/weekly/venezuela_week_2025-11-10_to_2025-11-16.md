**Weekly Watch Report: Venezuela**

**Factual Summary:**

In the past week, tensions between Venezuela and the United States have intensified. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, which has been met with significant concern from the Venezuelan government. In response, Venezuela has mobilized its military forces and issued calls for regional solidarity against what it perceives as a growing threat from the U.S. This military posturing comes amidst ongoing diplomatic rhetoric from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who continues to advocate for peace and regional unity, albeit without any tangible de-escalation in actions.

**Scenario Assessment:**

1. **Prolonged Coercive Standoff**: The plausibility of a prolonged coercive standoff has increased. The recent military activities and mobilizations by both the U.S. and Venezuela suggest an entrenchment of positions rather than a resolution. The rhetoric and actions from both sides indicate a continued escalation, making this scenario more likely.

2. **Strategic Accommodation**: The likelihood of strategic accommodation has decreased. Despite President Maduro's public appeals for peace, the simultaneous military buildup and aggressive rhetoric from both nations suggest a hardening of positions. This indicates a reduced probability of any immediate diplomatic resolution or cooperation.

3. **U.S. Escalation Toward Regime Change**: The plausibility of this scenario remains steady. While the U.S. has bolstered its military presence, there has been no definitive move towards a strategy explicitly aimed at regime change. The situation remains tense, but without clear evidence of an escalation towards this outcome.

**Forward Outlook:**

- Monitor any further military deployments or exercises by the U.S. in the Caribbean, which may influence regional security dynamics.
- Observe Venezuela's diplomatic engagements with regional allies, particularly any efforts to rally support against perceived U.S. aggression.
- Track statements and actions from both the U.S. and Venezuelan governments for any shifts in rhetoric or policy that might indicate changes in their strategic approaches.
- Pay attention to any international mediation efforts or calls for dialogue that could signal a potential de-escalation of tensions.
- Watch for internal developments within Venezuela, such as economic or political shifts, that might affect the government's stance or capacity to respond to external pressures.
