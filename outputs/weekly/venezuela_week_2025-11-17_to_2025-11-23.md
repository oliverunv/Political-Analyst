**Weekly Watch Report: Venezuela**

**Factual Summary:**
In the past week, the geopolitical landscape between Venezuela and the United States has remained tense. The United States has maintained its military presence in the Caribbean, with naval forces positioned near Venezuelan waters. This continued pressure has been met with a defensive posture from the Venezuelan government, which has deployed heavy weaponry in response. Meanwhile, diplomatic engagements remain strained, with no significant breakthroughs in negotiations or changes in alliances reported.

**Scenario Assessment:**

- **Prolonged Coercive Standoff:** The plausibility of this scenario remains steady as both the United States and Venezuela continue to engage in a military standoff without significant escalation or de-escalation. The presence of U.S. naval forces and Venezuela's military readiness indicate that both parties are maintaining their positions without altering their strategic approaches.

- **Strategic Accommodation:** The likelihood of a strategic accommodation has decreased. Although President Maduro has expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue, the U.S. has not reciprocated with any reduction in military pressure or sanctions. President Trump's continued openness to potential military intervention further diminishes the chances of a diplomatic resolution in the near term.

- **U.S. Escalation Toward Regime Change:** The plausibility of this scenario has increased. The U.S. has intensified its military presence and there are reports of potential new operations targeting Maduro's regime. Discussions within the U.S. administration about classifying Maduro's government as a terrorist organization suggest a shift towards more aggressive tactics, indicating a possible move towards regime change.

**Forward Outlook:**

- Monitor any changes in U.S. military deployments in the Caribbean that could indicate either escalation or de-escalation in military posture.
- Observe any diplomatic communications or negotiations between Venezuela and the United States that could signal a shift towards or away from strategic accommodation.
- Track developments regarding U.S. policy decisions, particularly those related to sanctions or designations of Maduro's regime, which could impact the overall geopolitical strategy.
- Keep an eye on regional responses from neighboring countries in Latin America, which may influence or react to the U.S.-Venezuela standoff.
- Watch for any internal developments within Venezuela, such as economic or political shifts, that may affect the government's stability and its approach to international pressure.
