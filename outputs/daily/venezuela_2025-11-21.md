The United States has reportedly escalated its stance against Venezuela, with President Trump allegedly authorizing CIA operations within the country. This move represents a significant shift from diplomatic pressure to potential covert actions. Additionally, the U.S. has formally declared Venezuela's Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, targeting the power structure of President Nicolás Maduro. Meanwhile, Venezuela's Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, has threatened to declare opposition leader María Corina Machado a "fugitive" if she travels to Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. On the economic front, President Nicolás Maduro announced that Venezuela is prepared to export gas to Colombia for the first time, following an agreement to establish a binational economic zone. In a separate development, Colombian President Gustavo Petro proposed a "shared transition government" in Venezuela to address the ongoing crisis and prevent foreign intervention.
