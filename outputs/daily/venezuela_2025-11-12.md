Venezuela has initiated a significant military mobilization in response to the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the largest U.S. aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean Sea near its coast. This move by the United States is part of a broader initiative to combat drug trafficking in the region, led by the Trump administration. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has ordered military exercises to prepare for potential foreign aggression, involving the army, militias, police, and community leaders. The situation has heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with concerns about a possible conflict escalating. Additionally, the Strategic Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Russia and Venezuela has come into effect, further solidifying their bilateral relations. The Russian parliament has called for international condemnation of what it describes as provocative actions by the United States against Venezuela. This development adds another layer of complexity to the geopolitical dynamics in the region.
