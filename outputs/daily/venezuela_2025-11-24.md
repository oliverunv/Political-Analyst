The United States has announced plans to formally designate Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as a member of a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This move is intended to enable new sanctions against Venezuela and increase the U.S. military presence near the country. In response to rising tensions, President Maduro performed a "peace dance," promoting dialogue and peace with American youth. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a warning to U.S. airlines about potential threats when flying over Venezuela due to a worsening security situation and increased military activity. As a result, six airlines have canceled flights to Venezuela, citing the heightened military presence in the region. Additionally, both Caracas and Washington have expressed a renewed willingness to engage in dialogue, despite the ongoing military buildup and diplomatic tensions.
