The situation in Venezuela remains tense as the United States increases its military presence in the Caribbean, marking the largest buildup in over 35 years. President Donald Trump has stated that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's "days are numbered," intensifying the pressure on Maduro's regime. In response, Maduro has accused the U.S. of conducting a "psychological war" against Venezuela and has vowed to counter it with "work, deeds, and actions." Additionally, Maduro claimed that two aircraft linked to narcotrafficking entered Venezuelan airspace amid the U.S. military deployment, although these planes were reportedly destroyed. Seeking international support, Maduro has reached out to Russia and China for military cooperation to counter U.S. actions. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Venezuela has updated the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, which is crucial for economic transactions in the country.
