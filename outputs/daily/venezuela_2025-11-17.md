The United States is increasing its military presence near Venezuela, with the arrival of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford in the Caribbean. This move is part of a broader strategy to apply pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. government has designated the alleged Cartel of the Suns, which it claims is linked to Maduro, as a terrorist organization. This designation could potentially allow the U.S. to impose further sanctions and take action against assets and infrastructure associated with Maduro within Venezuela.

President Donald Trump has stated that the U.S. might be engaging in discussions with Maduro, suggesting a potential diplomatic channel amid the military buildup. Trump mentioned that Venezuela is interested in dialogue, although no specific details about these discussions have been disclosed. Meanwhile, Maduro has responded to the increased U.S. military presence by promoting a message of peace, notably singing John Lennon’s "Imagine" at a public rally.
