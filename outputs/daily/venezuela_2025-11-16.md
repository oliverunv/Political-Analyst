Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has publicly called for peace amid escalating tensions with the United States. During a recent event in Caracas, Maduro sang John Lennon's "Imagine" as a symbolic gesture to appeal for peace with U.S. President Donald Trump. This comes as the U.S. reportedly considers military options against Venezuela, with increased military presence near the country's coast. In response, Maduro has urged Venezuelans to engage in a "permanent mobilization" and organized vigils and marches in six eastern regions of the country to demonstrate against perceived U.S. military threats. Meanwhile, President Trump has stated that progress has been made in curbing drug trafficking from Venezuela, though he did not disclose specific details about potential actions against the country. These developments highlight the ongoing diplomatic and military tensions between the two nations.
