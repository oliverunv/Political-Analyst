Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has released a "freedom manifesto" from a secret location, calling for accountability for President Nicolás Maduro regarding alleged crimes against humanity. Machado, who recently received a Nobel Peace Prize, envisions a new era for Venezuela without Maduro. Meanwhile, President Maduro has been using state media to promote a cartoon alter-ego, "Super Mustache," as part of a propaganda campaign amidst increasing U.S. pressure. In a separate development, U.S. President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to prepare covert operations in Venezuela, as part of a broader strategy to pressure the Maduro regime. This comes as tensions rise between the U.S. and Venezuela, with military presence in the Caribbean. Additionally, in a symbolic gesture, Maduro declared Jesus Christ as the "owner" of Venezuela during a prayer meeting for peace. On the sports front, Canada defeated Venezuela 2-0 in an international friendly soccer match, which saw both teams reduced to ten men following red cards.
