**Daily Update on Venezuela**

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has publicly rejected recent U.S. measures and demands, emphasizing his commitment to Venezuela's sovereignty and independence. This response comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, with the U.S. military increasing its presence in Puerto Rico, positioning it as a strategic hub for operations in the Caribbean. This move has intensified concerns over potential military conflict in the region. Additionally, a group of U.S. senators announced plans to introduce a resolution to require congressional approval for any military action against Venezuela, should President Trump decide to proceed with such measures.

Amid these geopolitical tensions, Venezuela has revoked flight concessions for Plus Ultra and Air Europa, following similar actions against other airlines, in response to the suspension of their services to the country. This has further complicated travel, with many opting to cross the border into Colombia by land due to the ongoing air travel disruptions.
