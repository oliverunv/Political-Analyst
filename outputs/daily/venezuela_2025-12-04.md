Maduro described the call as respectful and initiated by the White House. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of State has maintained a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory for Venezuela due to rising tensions related to the U.S.'s anti-drug trafficking campaign and pressure on the Maduro government. In aviation developments, Panamanian airline Copa Airlines and several other international carriers have suspended flights to and from Venezuela, citing navigation signal issues and security alerts from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
