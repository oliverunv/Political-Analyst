**Weekly Watch Report: Venezuela**

**Factual Summary:**
In the past week, tensions have escalated in the Caribbean region as the United States increased its military presence, a move that has been perceived as a show of force against the Venezuelan government. This development follows recent statements from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Venezuelan airspace, which have further strained relations. Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, backed by allies Russia and China, continues to display defiance towards U.S. actions and rhetoric.

**Scenario Assessment:**

- **Prolonged Coercive Standoff:** The likelihood of this scenario has increased. The recent U.S. military maneuvers and heightened rhetoric have not been met with any conciliatory gestures from the Maduro government, which remains staunchly supported by Russia and China. This suggests a continuation of the current standoff without resolution in the near term.

- **Strategic Accommodation:** The plausibility of this scenario has decreased. The hardening of positions on both sides, with the U.S. escalating its military presence and Maduro's firm opposition to perceived threats, reduces the chances of a strategic shift towards engagement or accommodation.

- **U.S. Escalation Toward Regime Change:** The likelihood of this scenario remains steady. Despite increased pressure, the absence of concrete actions beyond military posturing and diplomatic discussions indicates that a full-scale escalation towards regime change is not imminent at this stage.

**Forward Outlook:**

- Monitor any further U.S. military activities in the Caribbean that may signal an escalation or change in strategy towards Venezuela.
- Observe any diplomatic engagements or statements from Russia and China regarding their support for Venezuela, which could influence the geopolitical dynamics.
- Watch for potential responses from the Maduro government, particularly any moves that could either escalate tensions or signal a shift in strategy.
- Pay attention to regional reactions or involvement from neighboring countries, which might affect the broader geopolitical landscape.
- Keep an eye on international diplomatic efforts or statements from multilateral organizations that could impact the situation or offer pathways for de-escalation.
