The Senate is preparing to vote on a bipartisan measure aimed at preventing Trump from initiating military action against Venezuela.

Additionally, Pope Leo has publicly criticized President Trump's military actions near Venezuela and his administration's treatment of migrants. The Venezuelan government, under Nicolás Maduro, continues to prepare for potential asymmetric warfare, with military assets from various countries, including Iran, Russia, and China.
