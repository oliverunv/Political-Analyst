**Weekly Watch Report: Venezuela**

**Factual Summary:**
In the past week, tensions between Venezuela and the United States have intensified. The United States has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, notably with the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, a significant naval asset. This move comes amidst heightened rhetoric from Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro, who has accused the U.S. of fabricating a war and has spoken of a "new eternal war." Additionally, the U.S. military has engaged in operations targeting alleged drug trafficking activities linked to the Venezuelan regime, further straining relations between the two countries.

**Scenario Assessment:**
- **Prolonged Coercive Standoff:** The likelihood of a prolonged standoff has increased. The U.S. military's strategic deployment in the region, coupled with Maduro's confrontational rhetoric, suggests a sustained period of tension without direct military confrontation. This scenario aligns with the current posture of both nations, where pressure is applied through military presence and diplomatic rhetoric rather than direct engagement.
  
- **Strategic Accommodation:** The plausibility of strategic accommodation has decreased. Recent developments indicate a shift away from diplomatic engagement towards a more adversarial stance. The U.S. military buildup and Maduro's aggressive statements reflect a departure from any potential diplomatic resolutions, reducing the chances of reaching a strategic compromise in the immediate future.

- **U.S. Escalation Toward Regime Change:** The possibility of U.S. escalation toward regime change has seen an increase. The military actions, including operations against drug trafficking networks associated with the Venezuelan government, suggest a more assertive U.S. approach. This shift points towards a potential escalation in efforts to undermine Maduro's regime through increased pressure and military presence.

**Forward Outlook:**
- Monitor the U.S. military's activities in the Caribbean, particularly any changes in naval deployments or operations that could signal a shift in strategy.
- Observe any further rhetoric or policy announcements from President Maduro that could indicate a change in Venezuela's stance or strategy.
- Track international diplomatic responses, particularly from regional actors and allies, to gauge broader geopolitical impacts.
- Watch for any developments in U.S. domestic policy or statements from key officials that could influence the U.S. approach towards Venezuela.
- Keep an eye on economic indicators within Venezuela, as these could impact the internal stability and influence the government's external posture.
