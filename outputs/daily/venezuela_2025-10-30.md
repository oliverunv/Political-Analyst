On October 29, 2025, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced that he has requested the Supreme Court of Justice to consider revoking the nationality of individuals who support foreign military interventions in Venezuela. This move targets those Maduro refers to as "vendepatria" or traitors. Meanwhile, Venezuelan oil tankers continue to operate in the Caribbean despite a U.S. embargo, while the U.S. military targets boats suspected of drug trafficking. In the coastal state of Falcón, local fishermen express concerns over security crackdowns by Maduro's government, which they claim are more threatening than U.S. military actions. Additionally, the opposition party Vente Venezuela reported the disappearance of two men linked to the family of opposition leader María Corina Machado, alleging they have been forcibly disappeared without access to legal representation or communication with their families. Lastly, the Venezuelan government continues to distribute financial aid through the Sistema Patria amid ongoing economic challenges.
