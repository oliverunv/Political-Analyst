Venezuela has heightened its military readiness following the deployment of the United States' largest aircraft carrier strike group in the Caribbean Sea. President Nicolás Maduro has ordered a "massive mobilisation" of Venezuelan military forces in response to what he perceives as an aggressive move by the U.S. aimed at intensifying its crackdown on drug trafficking. This development has led to increased tension between the two nations, with Venezuelans expressing a mix of fear and skepticism about the presence of U.S. military forces in the region. Meanwhile, Venezuela's military reported intercepting an unauthorized aircraft that entered its airspace, further underscoring the heightened state of alert. Additionally, Russia has expressed its readiness to support Venezuela amidst the growing U.S. military presence. These events come as the Banco Central de Venezuela continues to monitor the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, which remains a critical economic factor for the country.
