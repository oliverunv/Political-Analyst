Venezuela's government, led by President Nicolás Maduro, has introduced a revamped mobile application called VenApp, encouraging citizens to report suspicious activities amid escalating tensions with the United States. This move comes as Venezuela claims to have dismantled a CIA-financed cell allegedly plotting a false-flag attack on a U.S. warship in the southern Caribbean. Concurrently, the U.S. has increased military pressure by deploying bombers near Venezuela. In response to these developments, Russia has maintained open communication channels with Venezuela and has reportedly sent new air defense systems to the country. Russian officials have also suggested the possibility of providing Venezuela with hypersonic missiles as a deterrent against potential U.S. military actions.
