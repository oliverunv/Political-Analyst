**Weekly Watch Report: Venezuela**

**Factual Summary:**
Over the past week, Venezuela has continued to experience heightened tensions with the United States. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, which has been met with Venezuela's deployment of Russian missile systems. Despite these developments, there has been no significant escalation beyond the current standoff. Regional governments have maintained their opposition to foreign intervention, supporting a status quo stance. Meanwhile, U.S. officials, including President Trump, have reiterated their hardline position against the Maduro regime, emphasizing pressure over negotiation.

**Scenario Assessment:**

1. **Prolonged Coercive Standoff:** The scenario of a prolonged standoff remains steady. The deployment of Russian missile systems by Venezuela in response to the U.S. military presence suggests a continuation of the current deadlock rather than an escalation. Regional opposition to intervention further supports the persistence of the status quo.

2. **Strategic Accommodation:** The plausibility of strategic accommodation has decreased. Recent statements from U.S. leadership emphasize a firm stance against the Maduro government, reducing the likelihood of any shift toward negotiation or accommodation. The focus remains on maintaining pressure rather than seeking a diplomatic resolution.

3. **U.S. Escalation Toward Regime Change:** The plausibility of U.S. escalation toward regime change has increased. The U.S. has not only bolstered its military presence but also intensified its rhetoric against Maduro. Reports of potential military strikes and comments from a former admiral highlight a growing possibility of escalation, although no actions have been taken yet.

**Forward Outlook:**

- Monitor any changes in the U.S. military posture in the Caribbean and any corresponding responses from Venezuela.
- Observe statements from regional governments and international bodies regarding their stance on intervention in Venezuela.
- Watch for any new diplomatic initiatives or shifts in rhetoric from both the U.S. and Venezuelan governments.
- Keep an eye on the domestic political situation in Venezuela, including any developments within the Maduro regime or opposition movements.
- Track any further reports or indications of potential military actions or strategic shifts in U.S. policy towards Venezuela.
